Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece,
always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.
Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems.

An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: 

At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution to the complete problem. 
Some popular Greedy Algorithms are Fractional Knapsack, Dijkstra’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm, Huffman coding and Prim’s Algorithm
The greedy algorithms are sometimes also used to get an approximation for Hard optimization problems. 
For example, the Traveling Salesman Problem is an NP-Hard problem.
A Greedy choice for this problem is to pick the nearest unvisited city from the current city at every step. 
These solutions don’t always produce the best optimal solution but can be used to get an approximately optimal solution.
